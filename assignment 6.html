    <h1>Black Hole Theory</h1>
    <p>It is a concept of a subject from where nothing can escape even light can't whose speed is 3x10 <sup>8</sup>m/sec. Most famously, black holes were predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, which showed that a massive star dies, it leaves behind a small, dense remnant core.Black holes is the concept of high gravitational space along that space where the black hole reside. In that area everything is absorbed by it. If the core's mass is more than about three times the mass of the sun, the equations showed, the force of the gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole.<strong><ins>Do you know how the black holes generated?</ins></strong> Let me tell you that how the whole process happens. Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion.(Smaller stars become dense neutron stars, which are not massive enough to trap light.)If the total mass of the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun.), it can be proven theoritically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity. However, as the star collapses, a strange thing occurs. As the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface reaches the event horizion, time stands still, and the star can collapse no more-it is a frozen collapsing object.</p>
    <p><strong><ins><a href="assignment7.html" target="_blank()" >According to Stephen Hawking,</a></ins></strong> In 1976 Stephan Hawking suggested that, as black holes evaporate, they destroy information about what had formed them. The idea goes against a fundamental law of <ins>Quantum Mechanics</ins>which states any process in physics can be mathematically reserved. In 1960s, physicist John Archibald Wheeler, discussing black holes'lack of abservable features beyond their total mass,spin, and charge, coined the phrase "black holes have no hair"-known as the no-hair theorem. However, the newly discover "quantum hair" provides a way for information to be preserved as a black hole collapse and, as such, resolves one of modern science's most famous quandaries, experts say. "However, in the quantum theory, the state of the matter that collapses and forms the black hole continues to affect the state of the exterior, albeit in a way that is compatible with present experimental bounds. This is what is known as 'quantum hair'."</p>
    <p><strong><ins>Conclusion</ins></strong></p>
    <ul>
       <li>Black holes have the highest gravitational forces which attracts anything towards it.</li>
       <li>Black holes absorbes even light in it.</li>
       <li>Black holes forms when a star dies.</li>
       <li>There is theory which states that if the black holes form continuously then there is no history of blackholes about from where they formed.</li>
       <li>Black holes also formed by collapse of two individual stars.</li>
    </ul>
