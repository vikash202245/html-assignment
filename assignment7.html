    <h1><ins>According to Stephan Hawking</ins></h1>
    <p>He was the last physicist whose unique profile transcended the boundaries of science to become, like Einstein, an icon of popular culture. His image has remained linked to the field that accounted for the bulk of his work—black holes. The discoveries of Stephen Hawking (8 January 1942 – 14 April 2018) shone light on the darkness of these mysterious astronomical objects, but at the same time raised questions that will continue to trouble scientists for decades to come. In the mind of the public, black holes are often imagined as huge cosmic vacuum cleaners that suck up everything in their path, including light. This is an evocative but incorrect idea. A black hole is not and does not create a vacuum, but quite the opposite; it attracts through the effect of gravity, because the density of its mass is so enormous. It follows that we should have nothing to fear if the Sun were to be replaced by a black hole of the same mass—though our world would be much colder and darker, the planets would continue to orbit undisturbed because the mass of the black hole would be equivalent to that of the Sun.</p>

    <p><strong>QUANTUM gravitational effects are usually ignored in calculations of the formation and evolution of black holes. The justification for this is that the radius of curvature of space-time outside the event horizon is very large compared to the Planck length (Għ/c3)1/2 ≈ 10<sup>−33</sup> cm, the length scale on which quantum fluctuations of the metric are expected to be of order unity. This means that the energy density of particles created by the gravitational field is small compared to the space-time curvature. Even though quantum effects may be small locally, they may still, however, add up to produce a significant effect over the lifetime of the Universe ≈ 10<sup>17</sup> s which is very long compared to the Planck time ≈ 10<sup>−43</sup> s. The purpose of this letter is to show that this indeed may be the case: it seems that any black hole will create and emit particles such as neutrinos or photons at just the rate that one would expect if the black hole was a body with a temperature of (κ/2π) (ħ/2k) ≈ 10<sup>−6</sup> (M/M)K where κ is the surface gravity of the black hole1. As a black hole emits this thermal radiation one would expect it to lose mass. This in turn would increase the surface gravity and so increase the rate of emission. The black hole would therefore have a finite life of the order of 10<sup>71</sup> (M/M)<sup>−3</sup> s. For a black hole of solar mass this is much longer than the age of the Universe. There might, however, be much smaller black holes which were formed by fluctuations in the early Universe<sup>2</sup>. Any such black hole of mass less than 10<sup>15</sup> g would have evaporated by now. Near the end of its life the rate of emission would be very high and about 10<sup>30</sup> erg would be released in the last 0.1 s. This is a fairly small explosion by astronomical standards but it is equivalent to about 1 million 1 Mton hydrogen bombs.</strong></p>
    <p>In 1974, a study by Hawking published in Nature shook the science of the time by proposing that black holes were not so black, nor did they grow endlessly as physicists, including himself, had previously assumed. His genius was to combine two traditionally irreconcilable worlds, general relativity—the Einsteinian gravity used to explain the formation and evolution of black holes—and quantum mechanics, which describes the nature of the subatomic world. In his earlier papers, Hawking had shown how relativity led to the singularity of a black hole, but then it was necessary to crack open the quantum chest to explain what was going on there. As Hawking would explain in the public version of his theory—formally incorrect for the sake of easier comprehension, as physicist Ethan Siegel explained—quantum theory suggests the continuous creation of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs that annihilate each other almost instantly. But if this happens right at the edge of a black hole’s event horizon, it may result in the negatively energetic antiparticle falling inwards, stealing energy from the black hole, and its partner escaping into space with identical positive energy. Eventually, this would lead to the total evaporation of the black hole with no matter or energy escaping from it; although, as Hawking pointed out in his study, “for a black hole of solar mass this is much longer than the age of the Universe.” In much smaller black holes it would be faster, culminating in a final explosion equivalent to “1 million 1-Mton hydrogen bombs,” he wrote.</p>
    <h3>Hawking Radiation</h3>
    <p>Hawking’s demonstration that black holes can emit radiation is “his most important result,” Juan Maldacena, a physicist at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study who has made major contributions in string theory and quantum gravity, tells OpenMind. But at the time, this Hawking radiation opened a real schism between relativistic and quantum physicists, as the latter now had a radical problem: if, according to quantum physics, the information associated with particles is never destroyed, but no matter or energy ever escapes a black hole, how can a black hole simply disappear, taking this information out of existence? Hawking radiation is widely accepted in current physics, although it is almost impossible to measure and therefore verify. Paradoxically, it is expelled in greater quantities by smaller, undetectable black holes, while the larger ones, those that astrophysicists can study directly, produce so little that it is indistinguishable from the Cosmic Background Radiation. But, at least, a similar phenomenon has been recreated in the laboratory: researchers at the Israel Technion Institute of Technology have generated analogues of tiny black holes that work with sound rather than light, and have managed to demonstrate something similar to Hawking radiation. These experiments have confirmed two of the physicist’s predictions: that the radiation is spontaneous—it is generated from empty space—and that it is stationary—it does not change in intensity over time.</p>
    <h3>THE “SOFT HAIR” OF BLACK HOLES</h3>
    <p>But for its part, the so-called information paradox has remained the most important of the questions raised by Hawking’s work, in the opinion of Maldacena. This question has kept physicists busy for the last half century, including Hawking himself, who until his death searched tirelessly for a theory capable of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, in other words, a quantum theory of gravity that describes what happens inside black holes. The famous physicist’s last works proposed a solution to information retrieval. In the 1970s, John Wheeler—who popularised the term “black hole”—and Jacob Bekenstein claimed that “black holes have no hair,” in the sense that “the only properties a black hole could have were its mass, its electric charge and its angular momentum,” Cambridge University physicist Malcolm Perry, a collaborator of Hawking’s, tells OpenMind. Thus, “if one observed a black hole, you could tell nothing about how it was formed,” since all other information is lost inside it; the event horizon is, so to speak, a denuded boundary, shorn of all information. However, in 2018, Hawking, Perry and their collaborators found a theoretical way to propose that black holes can have “soft hair”, “an infinite collection of extra properties that a black hole can have,” says Perry. As Marika Taylor, a physicist at the University of Southampton whose PhD thesis was supervised by Hawking, tells OpenMind, this metaphorical hair “suggests ways in which black holes may keep track of information at their surfaces, so that this information is ultimately recovered.” But Perry cautions that while these ideas advance a possible resolution of the information paradox, they are not the final word. “My view is that soft hair is part of the resolution of these puzzles, but not all of it; there is further to go,” he says. Recently, other models in addition to soft hair have emerged. “There have been exciting developments about recovering information from black holes over the last year or two,” adds Taylor. For Maldacena, these new developments represent “important milestones in the analysis of the information paradox.” According to Tom Banks, a Rutgers University physicist who shared scientific discussions with Hawking, the Briton’s contributions have been “the most important single piece of work contributing to our understanding—still very limited—of the connection between quantum mechanics and general relativity,” he tells OpenMind. This is a road that has been travelled for half a century and where much remains to be done. “Progress is good, but the timescale for solving these deepest-of-all problems is long,” Andrew Strominger, co-author of the soft hair study, at Harvard University, tells OpenMind. “We have been trying to understand black holes for a hundred years. I hope we can wrap it up in another 50.”</p>
